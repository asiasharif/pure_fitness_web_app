      <p>All members and guests must comply with these policies. These are incorporated into a Member’s Contract with
        us, and compliance with these policies is important both to maintain the standards and to enable Members to get
        full enjoyment from their Membership.
        Any person who does not comply with these policies may be ejected from, or denied access, or may have their
        Membership terminated if the non-compliance is serious.
        Your safety and that of our people, is our highest priority.
        As a result of COVID-19, things will operate a little differently around here and we are continuously monitoring
        the situation to make any necessary changes. As such, the policies will change slightly. If in doubt, please
        ask a member of our team.
        We reserve the right to make reasonable amendments to these policies, at any time. If we do this, we will give
        Members reasonable advance notice by placing the new policies on a notice board.
        Words and phrases in these policies have the same meanings as given in our Membership Terms & Conditions, unless
        specified otherwise.</p>

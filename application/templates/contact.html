          <p>Swimming is unique. It is the only physical activity that can be enjoyed from birth through to older age. Every week
            2.5 million adults go swimming. Swimming is one of the most effective ways to burn calories. A gentle swim can burn
            over 200 calories in just half an hour, more than double that of walking, while a faster swim would see that indulgent
            chocolate bar gone quicker than if you went running or cycling.
            Exercising in water also makes your body work harder, so 30 minutes in a pool is worth 45 minutes of the same activity
            on land. Water supports up to 90 per cent of the body’s weight making swimming the perfect way for people with
            impairments, injuries or illnesses to stay active. Swimming is great at relaxing the mind and helping to de‐stress.</p>
          <strong>Why do we have anti-wave ropes?</strong>
          <p>Anti-wave ropes provide a more comfortable swimming environment, as the name suggests they divide the pool up and
            prevent the turbulence/wave that maybe being generated in one area of the pool traveling across the pool into another.</p>
          <strong>How are our swimming lessons structured?</strong>
          <p>We follow the Swim England Learn to Swim Pathway which is an all-inclusive programme that encourages a fun approach
            to learning. Our lessons are designed to ensure that every person that learns to swim with us develops confidence
            and competence in the water.</p>

        <strong>What safety standards do we work to?</strong>
            <ul>We support the HSE’s strategic themes:
                <li>Acting together - Promoting broader ownership of health and safety</li>
                <li>Tackling ill health - Highlighting and tackling the costs of work-related ill health</li>

        <strong>How do we benchmark our standards?</strong>
        <p>Quest is the UK Quality Scheme for Sport and Leisure designed primarily for the management of leisure facilities, sports
            development teams and leisure development. Quest is managed on behalf of Sport England by Right Directions in
            partnership with Leisure-net Solutions. It defines industry standards and good practice, and encourages their
            ongoing development and delivery within a customer-focused management framework. Quest’s rigorous assessments
            challenge even the very best leisure facilities, universities and sports development teams in the UK. The National
            Benchmarking Service (NBS) provides critical data on the performance of leisure facilities.</p>
        <strong>What’s our safeguarding policy?</strong>
        <p>We recognise and support the aims of the NSPCC’s Child Protection in Sport unit which has a mission is to build the
            capacity of sports to safeguard children and young people in and through sport and to enable sports organisations
            to lead the way in keeping children safe from harm.</p>
        <ul>
            They aim to achieve this by:
        <li>Being a lead voice, champion</li>
        <li>Providing expert safeguarding and child protection advice</li>
        <li>Contributing safeguarding knowledge to policies, procedures and programmes</li>
        <li>Developing and delivering sports specific training, resources and guidance</li>
        <li>Coordinating, lobbying and advocating on behalf of the sector in response to government consultations</li>
        <li>Supporting research into a range of issues, developing understanding and an evidence base</li>
            <li>Consulting with children and young people</li></ul>
        <strong>Do you use CCTV?</strong>
        <p>We operate CCTV throughout our centres for security, safety and good management purposes. This may also include
            swimming pool areas (see also Poolview).</p>
        <strong>What Lifeguarding Standards do we work to?</strong>
        <p>All our lifeguards are qualified with the Royal Lifesaving Society (RLSS) National Pool Lifeguard Qualification
            (NPLQ). We actively promote and participate in the ukactive Code of Practice to raise standards within the sector.</p>
        <strong>Do we have defibrillators on site?</strong>
        <p>All our leisure centres are equipped with an AED (Automated External Defibrillators) and trained staff are on duty
            at all times.</p>
